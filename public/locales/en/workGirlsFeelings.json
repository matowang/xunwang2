	"description1": "\"Girl's Feelings\", which describes the state of the women's emotions in the process of growing up. It reflects the purity and shyness of the beginning of love. The sculpture expresses these feelings by showing the covering of the hands, slightly crossed feet , knees squeezed together, and head leaning shyly on the shoulders. She murmured the faint fragrance if the green apple with sweet and sour feelings. The pieces lets the viewer recall the time of first tastes of taboos, how the simple and small response made them blush back then. An age of infinite imagination."
