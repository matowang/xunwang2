    "description1": "Mothers are our life-givers, and \"Expectating\" shows life's origin, starting from the embryo in a mother's womb. She is expecting the birth of a new life, her own child. The sculpture conveys maternal love and the physical and metaphorical link between a mother and her child, starting from the beginning of our lives. Every life is a gift from heaven, tied to the mother's umbilical cord, the tool used in our first interactions."
