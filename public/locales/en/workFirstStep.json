    "description1": "\"First Step\" depicts our first steps, symbolizing a new beginning. The child learning to walk conveys an unforgettable experience and represents one of the most precious moments of our lives. This sculpture records the beginning of exploration and change, integrating the abstract concept of time and letting time and space coexist. The sequential motion adds depth to the seemingly static sculptures, allowing collectors and audiences alike to experience the works' visual movement and the flowing energy, making memories to flow through time and space, combining the past, the present, and the future."
