    "description1": "\"Love\" reminds people to cherish their lives and experience the beauty of each moment. Nothing matters without love, and this work depicts its ever-changing aspects. The joining of the figures creates layers and makes the sculpture look both soft and hard at the same time. This image reveals the essence of love and the soul's desire to receive it. The sculpture demonstrates the attraction between two people, depicting the most beautiful aspect of their lives. The love is so strong that it wants to enter each other's hearts, becoming a metaphor for the vitality and the value of existence."
