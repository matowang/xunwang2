    "description1": "\"Turning to Adult\" describes a person's transition from a child to a young adult, and I consider it to be my best work in the \"Space in Time\" sculptures. The sequence of motion tells stories of the past, the present, and the future, and anyone who focuses on only a single aspect of time can never envision eternity. Time and space are two worldly coordinates, which we can unite by connecting them with our memory. And I presented this unity in a stylized way, so that time appears eternal. Even though our childhood is one of the most precious journeys of our lives, it becomes easily forgotten as we grow older. So I made this sculpture to let us view an eternal fragment of growth, making our memories coexist in both time and space."
