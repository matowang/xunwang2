    "description1": "\"Competition 1\" and \"Competition 2\" were Xun Wang's first attempts at combining digital and stereoscopic art forms, and ultimately the first displays of the \"Space in Time\" sculptures. These two sculptures describe the two opposite points in life, the start and the end. Each person encounters challenges in their lives, and each one of these obstacles demands them to adapt. Xun Wang took a snapshot of time and presented these moments in a three-dimensional form, flowing with memories."
