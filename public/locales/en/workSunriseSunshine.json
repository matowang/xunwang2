	"description1": "2022 \"Shunrise Shunshine\" awakens all things and radiates on flowers and grass. The sun shines through the windows and lands on the eyes of the soul, warming the body. The body language of this sculpture shows that feet and hands are open to absorb the energy of the sun. The cheeks feel just enough warmth. The right foot is lowered and stretched close to the horizon, feeling the aura of the earth. The upper right arm, consistent with the ridgeline of the peak, symbolizes the endless vitality. The surroundings feel of mountains with glowing air. The beauty of the sun is what makes life. Sunshine tells us that life, like the sun, has miraculous value and power all the time."
