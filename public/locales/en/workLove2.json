    "description1": "\"Love 2\" 2020 is the continuation of love. It is composed of densely layered and closely related intersecting images. Love, like two souls, yearns to turn over the clouds and rain in love and let the hearts touch each other seamlessly. \"Love 2\" is a kind of soul. The ultimate extension of the aesthetic experience of the body symbolizes the strong desire to enter the depths of each other's hearts and the lingering beauty. Through the shape of the work, this beauty ingeniously metaphors the energy of life and the basic primitive value of spiritual existence, and truly records the achievement and existence of love in the vast world."
